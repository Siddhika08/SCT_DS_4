# SCT_DS_4
Task 04 – Traffic Accident Data Analysis  Goal: Analyze patterns in road accidents based on weather, visibility, time of day, and road conditions. Dataset: US Accidents (2016–2021) – 7 million+ accident records across the United States.
🔍 Objective

The goal of this task is to perform an in-depth analysis of traffic accident data to understand how environmental and situational factors—such as weather, time of day, and road conditions—affect accident frequency and severity across different regions.

🧠 Steps Performed

Dataset Loading & Cleaning

Imported the US Accidents dataset from Kaggle.

Handled missing values and standardized columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explored relationships between weather, visibility, and accident severity.

Analyzed accident distribution by time (hour, weekday, month).

Examined spatial patterns using city and state data.

Data Visualization

Created bar and line charts for time-based trends.

Generated heatmaps for correlations.

Visualized accident hotspots using latitude-longitude plots.

Insights

Higher accident frequency during rush hours (7–9 AM, 5–8 PM).

Poor visibility, rain, and wet roads significantly increase accident likelihood.

Some states (like California and Florida) show consistently high accident density.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
